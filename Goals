 *Goals for Zotero development*

_New Translators_
 * Write import/export translator for Zotero's JSON (or citeproc-js's JSON)
   * This would make it easier to force-feed Zotero full-fledged items
   * Also for alternatively pathways of citation processor integration
 * Write import translator for BMC XML, http://www.biomedcentral.com/xml/article.dtd
 * Write translator for Microsoft Academic Search

_Broken Translators_
 * MetaPress (SpringerLink) 
 * IngentaConnect imprints (need for Brill)
 * Biomedcentral is between formats and needs special-cased treatment (http://forums.zotero.org/discussion/17365/)
 * Sage journals (http://forums.zotero.org/discussion/18592/)

_In-Progress Translators_
 * fix ISI behavior
 * Make ACM connector-friendly
 * Explore EZProxy+JSTOR issues (http://forums.zotero.org/discussion/15987/)
 * Write email translator (undertested, etc.-- but now in github)

_Other Zotero Features_
 * RTF scan fixes, see http://forums.zotero.org/discussion/16751. Gnotero integration would provide something akin to Papers2's Magic Manuscripts
   * "inability to read names with accent marks" http://forums.zotero.org/discussion/17040
   * "Author suppression doesn't work well--a symbol is probably required (like the one used in Bookends) in order to force suppression e.g. {-Author, 1995, 45}" (Ibid.)
 * Identifiers
 * PDF metadata lookup fallback

_Scholarly Process_
 * Start using XML-TILE or other textual annotation system, and find a way to integrate with Zotero
 * Integrate OCR, or integrate Archive.org OCR more tightly
   * Papers2 uses Tesseract-- I've been looking at it too, but we'd need training data
 * Image capture-- scanning, folder watching, etc.
 * Full-text indexing for more file types, see http://forums.zotero.org/discussion/17075/
   * Extend interfaces in /chrome/content/zotero/xpcom/fulltext.js

_Data Model_
 * Write an RDF triple store for the Firefox/XULRunner environment, and allow it to integrate with Zotero
   * Possibly use file attachments on items to store the RDF.
   * This is intended to also serve as an Agent/Creator system, to allow metadata, statements of equivalency, etc., between author names
 * Add language tagging of items, and support for item-language-dependent styles (language of citation is language of source)
 * Add support for controlled vocabularies to Zotero, probably as assertions of equivalence between item data and URIs
 * Allow inter-item relationships to be classified (isReviewOf, refutes, cites) [they may have to be made directional to do this]
