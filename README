Bits and pieces of code from or for Zotero.

This is no longer the place to look for experimental versions of Zotero translators-- see the main translators repository at <https://github.com/zotero/translators> and my fork of it at <https://github.com/ajlyon/translators>. Translators I'm working on can usually be found in the latter. If you came here looking for a translator I posted to the Zotero forums, please post again to the forums so I can point you to its latest incarnation.

See <http://zotero.org> for information on that project.
