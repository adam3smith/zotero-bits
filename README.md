# Introduction

This is a repository of CSL citation styles.

# Guidelines

Files names for CSL style must follow these guidelines:

* all lower case
* only valid characters are numbers, a-z letters, and single dash
* include a "csl" extension

So, the following would be valid:

> test-style.csl

These would not:

* TestStyle.csl
* Test Style.csl
* test_style.txt
